Description: Tools for performing routine analysis and plotting tasks with
    environmental data from the System Wide Monitoring Program of the
    National Estuarine Research Reserve System <http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/>.
    This package builds on the functionality of the SWMPr package
    <https://cran.r-project.org/package=SWMPr>, which is used to retrieve and
    organize the data. The combined set of tools address common challenges
    associated with evaluating time series data collected during storm events,
    and is intended for use in reporting on these events.
